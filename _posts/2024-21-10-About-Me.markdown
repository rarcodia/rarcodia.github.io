I was born and raised in Italy and, before moving to Boston/Cambridge, I lived in Munich (Germany) for over 5 years. When I am not doing <a class="normal" href="/Research">research</a>, you can find me enjoying a few hobbies.

For instance, I have been playing basketball since I was a little kid and I have always loved watching the NBA. Of course, now I (have to) support the Celtics (Champs in 2024! You are welcome Boston). I also enjoy playing football (I mean soccer) and bouldering with friends, and lately I have started playing squash and tennis too.

Since a couple of years, I have been teaching myself to play guitar and this is now my relaxing evening hobby. I also love to collect and listen to records and I always try to buy local music everywhere I go.
