When I am not doing amazing and ground-breaking <a class="normal" href="/Research">research</a>, you can find me enjoying a few hobbies.

I have been playing basketball since I was a kid (21 years and counting). I have also found a team in Munich, where I currently live, which adopts the best approach to sports: when we lose, we drink a case of beer together; when we win.. we drink more (quite important to blend into the Bavarian culture).

I also really enjoy bouldering with friends, though some would say I get poor results. I proudly go by the nickname "blue lightning", which means that I am very good at doing easy/mediocre routes.

I am also trying to learn to play guitar, mostly by myself and without a strict method, which is probably why I am not very good at it.. but itâ€˜s slowly improving! I have also recently started to collect and listen to records, which is where a substantial fraction of my salary is currently going.
