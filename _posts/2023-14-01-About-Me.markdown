When I am not doing <a class="normal" href="/Research">research</a>, you can find me enjoying a few hobbies.

I have been playing basketball since I was a kid (21 years ago and counting!). Now that I live in Boston, finally I can watch NBA games at decent times! And, of course, now I (have to) support the Celtics.

I also enjoy bouldering with friends, though some would say I get poor results. In Munich I proudly went by the nickname "blue lightning", which means that I was very good at doing easy/mediocre routes.

I am also learning to play guitar by myself.. itâ€˜s (veery) slowly improving! Recently, I started to collect and listen to records and I always try to buy local music everywhere I go.
