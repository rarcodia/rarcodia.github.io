When I am not doing <a class="normal" href="/Research">research</a>, you can find me enjoying a few hobbies.

I have been playing basketball since I was a little kid. Now that I live in Boston, finally I can watch NBA games at decent times! And, of course, now I (have to) support the Celtics (Champs in 2024! You are welcome Boston). 

Lately I have started playing squash too, to the extent that my old knees allow me. I also enjoy bouldering, though some would say I get poor results. In Munich I proudly went by the nickname "blue lightning", which means that I was very good at doing easy/mediocre routes.

Since a couple of years, I have been teaching myself to play guitar.. itâ€˜s (veery) slowly improving and quite relaxing! I collect and listen to records and I always try to buy local music everywhere I go. I am always down for live music events and concerts, specially open air.
