I am currently a BHI Fellow at the <a class="normal" target="_blank" href="https://bhi.fas.harvard.edu/">Black Hole Initiative</a> at Harvard University. I was previously a NASA Einstein Fellow at the <a class="normal" target="_blank" href="https://space.mit.edu/">MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research</a>, and a postdoctoral researcher in Astrophysics working in the high-energy group of the <a class="normal" target="_blank" href="https://www.mpe.mpg.de/main">Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics</a> (MPE) in Garching (Germany), where I have also recently taken my PhD with the Thesis "Accretion onto black holes across the mass scale". For my research interests, see <a class="normal" href="/Research">here</a>.

Before coming to MPE, I took my Bachelor's degree in Physics and Master's degree in Astrophysics and Space Physics at the <a class="normal" target="_blank" href="https://www.fisica.unimib.it/en/research/astrophysics">University of Milan-Bicocca</a> (Milan, Italy), while carrying out both research projects at the nearby <a class="normal" target="_blank" href="http://www.brera.inaf.it/?page=chisiamo;lingua=inglese">Observatory of Brera-Merate</a>.
